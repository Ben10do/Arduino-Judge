HANDSHAKE
==========

Both Arduinos wait for two seconds, before doing anything else (to allow for the computer to communciate via Serial).
Both Arduinos send 0x64 repeatedly, until they hear the response 0x42
They then both send a random number. The board with the higher number is P1.
If they are both the same, then they both send another random number, until this is resolved.
Then, the game may begin.

GAME START
===========

Player 1 will send "NEWGAME", and will wait until Player 2 responds "READY"
Player 1 will send the ID of the next game (will be 0-5).
Both players will then generate a value (e.g. frequency, brightness, note), and send it to the other board.
Both players will then run the game.
When a player responds, they will send "Y" or "N", depending on if their pressed button is or is not the correct one.
Then, the other player will respond with "A" to acknowledge. If both players send "Y" or "N" before they send "A", player 1 will send 1 or 2 to indicate who won.
End game, return to game start.
